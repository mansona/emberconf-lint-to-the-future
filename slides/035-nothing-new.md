  So far I haven’t told you anything new. I've just set the scene and hopefully made sure everyone listening has a good foundational understanding of the purpose of a lint rule. But there are two examples in my little story that I suspect a lot of people listening don’t actually have embedded in their daily routines yet, and these are the two things that I said I wanted people to take away with them.

  Firstly, I said our Developer “wrote a new rule in their rules document”. Sure our example happens to be of a “rule” that I already exists and comes with every new Ember app. But what if I gave a different example? What if I gave a real example that I recently worked on with a client that I can not only guarantee that there isn’t a pre-written lint rule out there to cover this example, I will also say with some confidence that this rule won’t be that much use to anyone else.
