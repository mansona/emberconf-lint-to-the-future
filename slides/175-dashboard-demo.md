  Here is a little demo I recorded just moving through the dashboard and showing it off. Firstly you will notice the awesome styling of this dark mode. Major props to Anne-Greeth for this. And a little birdy tells me that she will be talking a little bit about designing for dark-mode so watch this space.

  You’ll see that we have a graph for each of the rules that are failing. But you can see that we have a contiguous graph from our first data point until “today”, this is actually filling in any gaps that you might have if you haven’t actually built it every day. You can also switch to week view and month view. You’ll see that everything on this graph started out in month view, it does this automatically once something crosses a certain threshold (and Anne-Greeth also contributed the month view so thanks again for that).

  Other than the graphs you can click this link here to see the list of all the files that still need to be improved. This is just here in case you wanted to cross reference or something, but really this app is all about the graphs!!
