  I had planned to reveal what the dashboard looks like a bit later in my talk but I couldn't contain my excitement! I'll show you a bit of a demo navigating through it in a bit but for now I'll go into a bit of detail how the dashboard works and where it keeps its data.

  In our example from before we talked about a big list of files that still need to be fixed. Essentially the fact that we are using file-based ignores for ember-template-lint is all that we need to tell the system what files still need to be improved.
