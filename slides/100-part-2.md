  Now we covered one of the things that I wanted you all to take away from this talk today. The other thing is the part in our developer’s story where I said “they wrote a list of all the places in the code that need to be changed and even put together a graph”…

  This is where a little tool I built comes into the picture, and happens to be the namesake of this talk.
