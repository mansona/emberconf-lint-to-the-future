  Let’s say that you’re a developer that is confident enough in your language of choice. We might be thinking JavaScript since we’re at EmberConf here but it could just as easily be “only” HTML and CSS, or if we wanted to go even more lo-fi we could be talking about someone who writes exclusively in Markdown. But let’s say that the developer in our story has been working on an established codebase for a few months and they have started to get to know it, some of the nice bits that feel all slick and modern, and some of the flaws and things that countless developers before them have vowed that they will get back to this and fix later, but of course never did!
