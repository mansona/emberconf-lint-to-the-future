  So if we run `npx lint-to-the-future ignore` it will automatically add those file based ignores to each of the files that failed when we checked.

  Now you are ready to commit and push your work!!

  This is a great first step along the journey to enabling a new lint rule in your codebase. If the codebase is still growing then all the new files from this point will be just that little bit better than they were before. Now we need something for the existing files, and this is where the the second and final feature of lint-to-the-future comes in: the dashboard.

# Ignore those errors

```sh

npx lint-to-the-future ignore


```
<!-- .element class="white-text" style="font-size: 1em;" -->
