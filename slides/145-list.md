  So lint-to-the-future has a little command that asks each of the plugins to list the files that have file-based ignores and what the rules they are ignoring.

  Let's have a quick look at what that outputs

# List those ignores

```sh

npx lint-to-the-future list --stdout


```
<!-- .element class="white-text" style="font-size: 1em;" -->
