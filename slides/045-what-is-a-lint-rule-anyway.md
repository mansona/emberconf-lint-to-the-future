  So what even is a linting rule? Iâ€™m not going to go super deep into the details here just because Iâ€™m not here for an hour long talk ðŸ˜‚ instead Iâ€™ll give you a bit of a conceptual overview and if you want to dig any deeper then I could recommend a workshop that a colleague of mine did for EmberConf 2 years ago. Itâ€™s all free and you can do it at your own pace ðŸŽ‰
