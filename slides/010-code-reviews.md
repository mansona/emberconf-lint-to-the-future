  Let’s say that our developer has also been participating in this new process their team is trying out called “code reviews” where a team member reviews their code before it’s added to the codebase. (remember folks, not every good practice that you believe in is truly universal. Trust me, there are teams out there that don’t even use version control!). Anyway our developer has begun to notice that everyone on the team keeps making this one mistake every so often, not every day or even once a month, but often enough that there are quite a few files in the codebase that have this problem now and it’s going to be a bit of work to find and fix all of those problematic files.
