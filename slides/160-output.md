  If you look in that folder you’ll see a static web app built for you and you’ll also notice a little `data.json` that happens to be the output of our list command from before.

  If you booted this static site up you would see a set of graphs with exactly one data point, because it only knows about today. If you want this app to do what it’s supposed to do and allow you to track things over time you need to tell it where it can find “yesterday’s” data by just passing it a link to the previous results:
