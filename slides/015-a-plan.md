  Our intrepid developer has come up with a plan to fix this problem though 🎉

  Step one in this plan is that they are going to start a “RULES” document that everyone needs to follow when reviewing code. And on this RULES document they are going to make the first rule about that mistake that they started to notice everyone make every so often. Let’s name this mistake so we can all have a concrete example to think about. Let’s say that it’s people forgetting to add alt text to images. Generally the developers on the team remember to include them, but sometimes the deadlines are a bit tight and the code reviews are a bit rushed so a few cases have fallen through the cracks. But now that we have this Rules document we double check that alt text is on each and every image as the new ones are getting added. That’s step one to fixing this particular codebase, no new images are going to be added without an alt text. But what about all the cases that slipped through the cracks before we enforced our RULES document!? Don’t worry, our developer has thought of step two and they have put together a plan to fix the existing issues in the codebase. They don’t have the time to stop everything and write a proper alt description of every broken image in the massive codebase right now, but they have put together a list of all the images that still need alt descriptions and they have shared this list with the team. Now they’re all going to slowly work together to fix the existing images over time alongside their existing work, and not only that! to help motivate the team our Developer has even put together a little graph to show the progress being made as each image is fixed. Never underestimate the power of a graph!!
