  Now let’s move on to writing a super quick example an ember-template-lint rule. You can follow the instructions in the readme on how to make a custom rule and I think this is explained a bit more in the AST workshop. But again skipping ahead let’s start with the example rule they have in the readmes:

  so for some reason this example starts with a comment statement. I guess it might be useful to be able to programatically read comments, but that’s not our game today!
