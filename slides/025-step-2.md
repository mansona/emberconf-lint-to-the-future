  But what about all the cases that slipped through the cracks before we enforced our RULES document!? Don’t worry, our developer has thought of step two and they have put together a plan to fix the existing issues in the codebase. They don’t have the time to stop everything and write a proper alt description of every broken image in the massive codebase right now, but they have put together a list of all the images that still need alt descriptions and they have shared this list with the team. Now they’re all going to slowly work together to fix the existing images over time alongside their existing work, and not only that! to help motivate the team our Developer has even put together a little graph to show the progress being made as each image is fixed. Never underestimate the power of a graph!!
