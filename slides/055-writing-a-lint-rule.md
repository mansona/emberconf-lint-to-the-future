  Next up we'll look at what it's like to write one of these lint rules because it’s a little bit different from writing things like tests. But before I do I want to partake in a little bit of audience participation. So firstly, can everyone raise their hands if you have ever written a test.

  Oh wait I can’t actually see your hands… so let’s try this a different way. Hey twitter people: have you ever written a test

  -> pause then show screenshot of the first answer

  Ok so that’s a pretty substantial margin of people. For the last few hold outs there, you gotta try it testing is epic.

  now, next question, how many of you have ever written a custom lint rule that was specifically for your code?
