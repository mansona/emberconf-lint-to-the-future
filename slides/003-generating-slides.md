  Today I’m talking to you about a process that you can adopt to improve your codebase.

  That may sound very broad and vague but that is actually true. The process isn’t tied to any single technology, it isn’t even an Ember specific thing. Not only that, you likely have used most of the tools needed this “process” before. There are just 2 things that I hope you will take away from this talk that might fundamentally change your approach to improving any of your codebases in the future. At least that’s my hope! And if I didn’t quite convince you or if I didn’t quite explain it well enough please do get in touch and let me know. I’m am personally on a constant journey to slowly improve how I communicate this process over time (and yes, that is a bit of foreshadowing for the content of the talk 😉). So let’s start our journey together with a bit of a story.
