notes: |
  now this command is kinda cool but It’s also not the fancy graphs that I was hinting at in our example at the start of this talk. but there is one thing to note in this output: it is structured by the date, then by the plugin and then by the rule. And these little arrays that you can’t really see in this screenshot: they are just a list of files that have the file-based ignores for that rule at the top.

  There is one more command that is interesting and the one that actually does the hard work for us building our lovely graphs
