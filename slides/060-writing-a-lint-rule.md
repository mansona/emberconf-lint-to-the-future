  Wow ok so I’m impressed. I knew there was going to be significantly fewer people having written a custom lint rule but I’m impressed that it’s hanging out around the 30% mark! Hopefully I will inspire a few of you to try it out after this talk and maybe we can bump that figure a little.

  So let’s write a slightly simplified example of a lint rule together. As I said earlier, there is that AST Workshop that will go into this in **way** more detail but for now we’re going to look at an absolutely crucial tool to use for writing linting rules:  AST Explorer.
