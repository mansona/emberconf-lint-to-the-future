  So that’s it for my talk. I hope I have given you all nice foundational perspective on what lints are, how useful they can be and how unlocking the skill of writing your own lint rules can be an incredibly powerful tool to gradually improve your codebase in a way that you personally design. And don’t forget to try out lint-to-the-future and setup your dashboard, never underestimate the power of a nice graph.
