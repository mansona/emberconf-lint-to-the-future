  Now I would suspect that everyone here at EmberConf will have picked up my very thin alegory but letâ€™s just spell it out in case anybody missed it. Our Rules document is actually our linting rules. If you have ever worked on an Ember app you will have experience with using linting because a newly generated Ember app has a whole plethora of helpful rules enabled by default and automatically baked into the default testing process. What I mean by that is that if you generate a new Ember app and run `npm test` then you will automatically run all the pre-configured linting rules. And do you know what? The rule in my example, alt text on images, is one of the lint rules that is automatically enabled for you ðŸŽ‰ Thanks to Mel Sumner and the amazing work by the Accessibility team there are a whole host of Accessibility rules enabled by default.
